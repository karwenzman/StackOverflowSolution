Application: SampleConverterCulture
Platform: x64
Framework: net8.0-windows

I. Project Goal
===============
Learn skills to enable 'Globalization' features.

The standard culture for WPF apps is 'en-US'. 
Therefore actions need to be taken, to respect the regional culture formats.
You will find obvious differences in date and currency formats.
a) currency => StringFormat={}{0:C}
   'en-US' it is '$'
   'en-GB' it is 'the pound sign'
   'de-DE' it is '€'
b) date
   'en-US' it is '12/30/2024'
   'en-GB' it is '30/12/2024'
   'de-DE' it is '30.12.2024'
   

II. Project Configuration
=========================
The static class 'CultureInfoHelper.cs' is implementing logic to set the culture globally.
The class 'CustomBinding.cs' is doing the same on a different way (work in progress).


X. Deployment
=============
If the application is deployed, it is necessary to make some files available for this process.
- appsettings.json
  Set the 'Build' property to 'Content'.
- Info.txt
  Set the 'Build' property to 'Content'.
